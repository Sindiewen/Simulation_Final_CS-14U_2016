Simulation Proposal Revised Draft

Theme: heartrate Driven 
Question/Problem to Solve:
    - With the Heart-rate of an actor, find the most optimal route to
        the destination without exceeding the actors heart-rate threshold
        with the folling parameters:
        - Actor's...
            maxBPM (max heartrate)
            actorAge (actor's age)
    - Program will calculate the actor's currentBPM and their idleBPM
        - WIll increase BPM while climbing,
        - Will Decrese while decending, being idle, waking on a flat path
            
List of Actors:

    - Hiker             : Yellow Capsule       
        - Above average heart-rate
        - WIll take more moderate routes
        
    - Body Builder      : Red Capsule 
        - Walks with weights and does exercies while jogging 
        - Very High Heart-rate
            - Will take hardest routes

    - Florist           : Green Capsule
        - Will "Stop and smell the flowers"
            - Takes the time to look at the beauty their surroundings
        - Calm
        - Will take more relaxed routes
        - average Heart-Rate

    - Business Worker   : Blue Capsule
        - Usually stuck in traffic/public transportation
            - Gets angry at how slowly everything moves around Theme
        - Will always take the most direct route But be compromised by heartrate
            - Will avoid hills
        - Below average heartrate

//////// Actor Values ////////

    Heart-Rate - Threshold :        maxBPM
        - The max heartrate of the actor before they start taking less demanding routes
            - Threshold Slider : Actor
                - 40 BPM Minimum to 220 BPM max
                
    Heart-Rate - Heartrate cost:    costBPM
        - The heart-rate cost to traverse obstacle
            + "heart-rate cost" adds a value to the actor's current heart-rate
            - "Heart-rate cost" Subtracts a value to the actor's current heart-rate

    HeartRate - Current Heartrate:  currentBPM
        - the current actor's heartrate

    HeartRate - Actor idleBPM:      idleBPM
        - The idle BPM of the actor
            - Will stay at this BPM when the actor is idle/doing easier tasks
            
    Age - Actor:                    actorAge
        - Stores the current actor Age
        
    Idle Time - Actor:              actorIdleTime
    - How long the actor has to stay idle to get back to a resonable heartrate
        - (max heartrate - actor age) = "safeBPM" to return to
        - If (currentBPM >= safeBPM)
            - Idle the actor
    - How long the actor needs to idle:
        - -1 BPM per 1-3 seconds untill actor's idleBPM

    Probability of prefered Route:  probabilityOfPreferedRoute
        - Uses a value of percentages:
            - 0% - 100% in increments of 10%
        - How often, the probability of an actor taking prefered route over harder route
            - Higher the percentage, the higher chance of taking a harder route
        - NOTE: This value is independent of their personality


//////// Pathway Values ////////

    Elevation   :
        - How high the hill/path is
            - How high the Height/elevation of the path increases the currentBPM of the actor 
            - Calculated by Z Rotation
                - If elevationBPM >= maxBPM
                    - Actor doesnt bother climbing, goes different direction
                    - UNLESS it's the cheapest, only route forward, then actor will proceed and 
                    idle at end of route till safeBPM reached

    Distance Traveled - Actor's distance traveled : 
        - The longer the distance, over time, the actor's heart-rate will increase.
            - Calculated by the unity units from their origin to their current distance
            - HR Increase calculuated by the unity distance units
                - Can be set by user for how many units for 1 BPM

    
Results:

    - Start Node
    - Goal Node
    - Distance Traveled by Actor
    - Time idled (if any)
    - Current HeartRate
    - Average heartrate
    - Highest Heartrate reached
    
    Compare data with other actors. See who was more efficient and faster getting to location
