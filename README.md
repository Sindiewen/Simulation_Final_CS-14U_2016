# Simulation_Final_CS-14U_2016
Simulation Final - Semester 3, Fall 2016

This is a AI similation project I made with the assistance of my teacher in the Fall 2016 semester of my CS degree.

Using dijkstra algorithm and a map I made modeled using primitive shapes in Unity based off of Gaur Pain from Xenoblade Chronicles, you can use various AI values in each of the actors, a start and end point to watch them take different paths to their destination.

Enjoy!
